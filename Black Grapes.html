<body><h4><p><strong>Black grapes have been grown in Europe and Asia for over 6,000 years. The black grapes we enjoy today (Vitis vinifera) come in two varieties â€” one grows in Western Asia near the Black Sea, and the other grows in the Americas. Most are cultivated for use in wine, but they also make a delicious and healthy snack.
